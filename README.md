# SKFSR: SKip-connected Feature-reuse Super-Resolution
A deep-learning model combines guidance of physics and data to learn observation functions accurately and efficiently, which conducts a linearization and preidiction of high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems.

## Introduction
- This repo provides code for the paper ["Fractal-constrained Deep Learning for Super-resolution of Turbulence with Zero or Few Label Data"](under review) by Jiaxin Wu, Min Luo, Boo Cheong Khoo and Pengzhi Lin.
- This study proposes a deep-learning model that constrained by fractal physics and utilizes zero / few data, for the high-resolution reconstruction of turbulent flows.

## Common usage
- Runing SKFSR_main.py with arguments 
- e.g., python SKFSR_main.py -m Super_SKFSR_DB_unsp_single -c Channel -b 32 -s 4 -e 1000 --load False
- Some basic denotes have been made in SKFSR_main.py

## General hyperparameters
- "case" for selecting numerical cases
- "method" for defining numerical approaches
template: (1) binarization scheme + (2) training strategy + (3) snapshot quantity, 
(1) binarization scheme: TB (truncated binarinzation) / DB (differential binarization)
(2) training strategy: unsp / semi / sup
(3) snapshot quantity: single (1) / few (30) / standard (120)

e.g., DB_unsp_single
